\title{Rounding Using Round Away From 0 Method}
\usage{
round_away_0(x, digits = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{numeric vector (can include NA values).}

\item{digits}{positive integer of length 1 between 0 (default) and 14, giving the amount of digits to round to.}
}
\value{
numeric vector of rounded values.
}
\description{
round_away_0 takes a numeric vector, rounds them to a specified digit amount using the round away from 0 method for ties (i.e. 1.5). This is the SAS method for rounding.
}
\details{
\code{round_away_0} is not designed for use at precision levels <= 1e-15
}
\examples{

vals_to_round = c(NA,-3.5:3.5,NA)
# [1]   NA -3.5 -2.5 -1.5 -0.5  0.5  1.5  2.5  3.5   NA

# round() will round to even numbers when tied at X.5
round(vals_to_round)
# [1] NA -4 -2 -2  0  0  2  2  4 NA

# round_away_0() will round away from 0 when tied at X.5
round_away_0(vals_to_round)
# [1] NA -4 -3 -2 -1  1  2  3  4 NA
