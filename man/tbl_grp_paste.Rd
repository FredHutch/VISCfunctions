\title{Pasting Together Information for Two Groups}
\usage{
tbl_grp_paste(data, vars_to_paste = "all", first_name = "Group1",
  second_name = "Group2", sep_val = " vs. ", alternative = c("two.sided",
  "less", "greater"), digits = 0, keep_all = TRUE, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{input dataset. User must use consistant naming throughout, with a underscore to seperate the group names from the measures (i.e. \code{Group1_mean} and \code{Group2_mean}). There also must be columns defining the group names (i.e. 'Group1' and 'Group2'), which are used to form the \code{Comparison} variable.}

\item{vars_to_paste}{vector of names of measures to paste together. Can be the predefined 'median_min_max' or 'mean_sd', or any variable as long as they have matching columns for each group (i.e. Group1_MyMeasure and Group2_MyMeasure). Multiple mesures can be requested. Also can specify "all" (default), which will run 'median_min_max' and 'mean_sd', as well as any pairs of columns in the proper format.}

\item{first_name}{name of first group (sting before the '_') . Default is 'Group1'.}

\item{second_name}{name of second group (sting before the '_'). Default is 'Group2'.}

\item{sep_val}{value to be pasted between the two measures. Default is ' vs. '.}

\item{alternative}{a character string specifying the alternative hypothesis, must be one of "two.sided" (default), "greater" or "less". Will be used in determining the value to be pasted between the group names.}

\item{digits}{integer indicating the number of decimal places to round to before pasting for numeric variables. Default is 0.}

\item{keep_all}{logical indicating if all other variables in \code{data} should be returned with the pasted variables}

\item{verbose}{a logical variable indicating if warnings and messages should be displayed.}
}
\value{
data.frame with all the pasted values requested. Each name will have '_comparison' at the end of the names (i.e. mean_comparison, median_comparison, ...)
}
\description{
Paste together information, often statistics, from two groups. Two predefined pasting exist, mean(sd) and median[min,max], but user may also paste any single measure together.
}
\details{
User must use consistant naming throughout, with a underscore to seperate the group names from the measures (i.e. \code{Group1_mean} and \code{Group2_mean}). There also must be columns defining the group names (i.e. \code{Group1} and \code{Group2}), which are used to form the \code{Comparison} variable.

\code{alternative} included as a parameter so the direction can easily be seen in one-sided test. If "two.sided" is selected the value to be pasted between the two group names will be set to \code{sep_val}, where "greater" will use " > " and "less" with use " < " as the pasting value.
