\usage{
cont_vs_binary(x, y, method = c("wilcox", "t"), paired = FALSE,
  verbose = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{numeric vector (can include NA values)}

\item{y}{vector with only 2 levels (can include NA values unless \code{paired = TRUE})}

\item{method}{what test to run (wilcox or t test)}

\item{paired}{a logical indicating whether you want a paired test.}

\item{verbose}{a logical variable indicating if warnings and messages should be displayed}

\item{...}{parameters to pass to wilcox_test or t.test functions. For example the testing direction (\code{alternative}) in either call or the \code{var.equal} in the t.test function.}
}
\value{
pvalue for comparing x at the different levels of y
}
\description{
Either Wilcox or T-Test Performed, for unpaired or paired data
}
\details{
Runs \code{wilcox_test()} in the coin package, with "exact" distribution and mid-ranks ties method.

For one sided tests if y is a factor variable the level order is respected, otherwise the levels will set to alphabetical order (i.e. if \code{alternative = less} then testing a < b )

If Paired = TRUE assumes the first observations of the first group matches the first observation of the second group, and so on. Also if \code{Paired = TRUE} then \code{y} must have the same number of samples for each level.

x <- c(rnorm(10,0,3), rnorm(10,3,3))
y <- c(rep('a', 10), rep('b', 10))
cont_vs_binary(x = x, y = y, method = 'wilcox', paired = FALSE)
cont_vs_binary(x = x, y = y, method = 'wilcox', paired = TRUE)
cont_vs_binary(x = x, y = y, method = 't', paired = FALSE)
